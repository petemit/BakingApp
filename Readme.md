Created by Peter Mitchell for the Udacity Nanodegree course.

Project name: BakingApp
App name: Bake It!  ---why the disparity?  I panicked. ;)  

Anyway, lots of fun on this app, also very challenging. 

As per the rubric, I chose athird party library to assist in the program--GSON, to convert the JSON into Java objects This came in handy when I was needing to serialize the Parcelable Recipe objects for use of communicating with the widget.  I learned some of the challenges of serializing and deserializing complex objects using GSON. 

Many thanks to previous Udacity projects to help me get through some rough spots, and of course, StackOverflow
